%h2 Banquet
%p In Chinese Culture, a marriage is considered the joining of two families. Thus the parents of the bride and groom get involved in their wedding planning, and invite their friends and family to celebrate the marriage of their children. We will have our Chinese banquet at the Maxi’s restaurant in Leeds, serving exquisite Cantonese & Peking cuisine.
